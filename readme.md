# Guess the Number Game! 

## Description 

Welcome to a mini game where you, the user, will be asked to guess a number between 1 and 20. The "correct" number that is to be guessed by you will be randomly generated by the program for every new run. 

This game is comprised of features including displaying whether the number is too high or too low for each guess, as well as decrementing the score by 1 for every incorrect guess. 

## How the game works 

The player will be given an initial score of 20 points. They will have to click on the "check" button after typing in their guess each time. 

When the player gets the number right, the background turns green and displays a message saying "ðŸŽ‰ Correct Number!". Moreover, their current score will be stored in the "high score" section, which will be retained for the next run. 

However, if the player ends up not guessing the right number before the score hits 0, a message saying "ðŸ’¥ You lost the game!" will be displayed. 

New runs can be initiated by clicking on the "Again!" button. 

Happy playing! :)
